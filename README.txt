How to Compile:
1. Unzip contents of lxj171130.zip into a folder named "lxj171130".
2. Run the command `javac lxj171130/*.java` to compile.
3. Run the command `java lxj171130.Fibonacci <n> <choice>` to execute Fibonacci.

where,
n - denotes nth Fibonacci Number has to be calculated
choice - 1 or 2
	1 for calculating Fibonacci Number using O(n) algorithm
	2 for calculating Fibonacci Number using O(log n) algorithm
